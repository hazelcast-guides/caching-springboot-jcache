:description: This tutorial will get you started with Hazelcast as a JCache provider for your Spring Boot application.

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

{description}

== Prerequisites

- JDK 1.8+
- Apache Maven 3.2+

== Spring Boot Application

To leverage JCache in your Spring Boot application, you will need to do the following:

- Add `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-cache` dependency
- Add `@EnableCaching` annotation to your main class
- Add `@CacheResult(cacheName = "books")` annotation to every method you want to cache
- Add `spring.cache.type=jcache` to your `application.properties` file

For more explanation on the Spring Boot and JCache topic, please check the related Spring Boot blog post: https://spring.io/blog/2014/04/14/cache-abstraction-jcache-jsr-107-annotations-support[Cache Abstraction: JCache].

The application will be a simple web service with two classes defined as follows:

.BookController.java
[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$src/main/java/com/hazelcast/springboot/caching/BookController.java[tag=BookController]
----

.BookService.java
[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$src/main/java/com/hazelcast/springboot/caching/BookService.java[tag=BookService]
----

The idea is that every call to the endpoint `/books/<isbn>` goes to the  `findBookNameByIsbn()` method, which would attempt to return cached results.

If there's no cached value, this method is executed and results cached.

== Using Hazelcast as JCache Provider

To use Hazelcast as the JCache provider, all you have to do is to add Hazelcast to your classpath:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::ROOT:example$pom.xml[tag=hazelcast,indent=0]
----

Then, you need to create a Hazelcast configuration with the `books` map configured. You can define it as `src/main/resources/hazelcast.yaml`.

.hazelcast.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
include::ROOT:example$src/main/resources/hazelcast.yaml[]
----

Finally, you can configure your application to use Hazelcast. You can use either client-server or embedded topology.

=== Client-server Configuration

You first need to start a Hazelcast server with the Hazelcast configuration defined in the previous step.

[tabs]
====

Docker::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 5701:5701 -v $(pwd)/modules/ROOT/examples/src/main/resources:/hazelcast -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhazelcast.config=/hazelcast/hazelcast.yaml" hazelcast/hazelcast
----
--

CLI::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
# Install Hazelcast CLI as described at
# https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-command-line#installation

wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/cache/cache-api/1.1.1/cache-api-1.1.1.jar
hz start -c src/main/resources/hazelcast.yaml -j cache-api-1.1.1.jar
----
--

====

Then, use the following `application.properties` for your Spring Boot application.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::ROOT:example$src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

To start the application, run the following command from the `modules/ROOT/examples` directory.

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

=== Embedded Hazelcast Configuration

If you prefer to run Hazelcast embedded in your Spring Boot application, then you need to use the following `application-embedded.properties` file.

.application-embedded.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::ROOT:example$src/main/resources/application-embedded.properties[]
----

To start the application, run the following command from the `modules/ROOT/examples` directory.

[source,bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=embedded
----

== Testing the Application

You should see that your application is successfully connected to Hazelcast.

----
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
        Member [172.30.63.9]:5701 - 75cd0b19-ee36-4e0a-9d9c-38c49f67f842 this
]
----

Then, you can test the application by executing the following command.

[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/books/12345
----

You should see the following:

```
Sample Book Name
```

The first time you execute this command, it should take some time to get the response. However, when you try it again, it should be instant. That means that the cache is used.
